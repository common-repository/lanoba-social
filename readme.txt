== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How customizable is the Plugin? =

The Lanoba Social plugin allows users to modify the text that appears around the widgets. It also allows to customize the placement of the login widget:
<ul>
 <li>On the login page</li>
 <li>On the registration page</li>
 <li>In the sidebar</li>
 <li>On top of the comment form</li>
</ul>

= How many social networks does Lanoba Social API support? =

Currently nine networks are being supported: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google +, Yahoo, Windows Live/MSN, MySpace, Foursquare and Salesforce.

= How will the user remember which network he/she last logged in with? =

The last network used to log in is highlighted with a yellow or green outline. If the user logs in using a different social account, Lanoba's linking will recognize the emails and join the accounts together. 

= Who owns the social profile data? Where is it stored? =

Permission is given to you from the user and therefore you own data. Lanoba simply stores it.

= How much does it cost? =

Lanoba is FREE for the first 5000 users. Above 5001 users, the cost is 4 cents per user/year and that cost reduces with volume. See Lanoba's pricing chart here.
